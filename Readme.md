# Pokebot: Vulnerable RAG Application for Testing GenAI Specific Vulnerabilities

Pokebot is a demonstration vulnerable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed for learning and testing specific vulnerabilities related to Generative AI (GenAI). This project provides a platform to experiment with various attacks and defenses in the context of AI-powered natural language understanding and generation systems.

## [Watch Demo](https://open.substack.com/pub/detoxioai/p/meet-pokebot-a-damn-vulnerable-rag?r=2wroxs&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true)

## Quick Start

Clone the repository and Install:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/safedep/pokebot
cd pokebot
pip install poetry
poetry install
poetry run pokebot rag start
```
above command will create a virtual env in case non exists

**Setup OpenAI API Key**

Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
```
Replace `<your_openai_api_key>` with your actual OpenAI API key.


**Running the Application**

Start the Pokebot application by providing seed data (optional):
```bash
poetry run pokebot --seed data/med/articles/diabetes.txt
```

**Alternatively use Pip**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python pokebot/main.py --seed data/med/articles/diabetes.txt
```

Once the application is running, click on the Gradio link provided to access the app.

## Usage

### Prompting Without Poisoning Data

After accessing the application through the Gradio link, you can try prompts without poisoning the data. For example:
```text
What is the best medicine for diabetes?
```

### Poisoning Data

To simulate data poisoning, select the "Poison" option and submit. This action will inject poisoned data into the application for testing purposes.

### Trying New Prompts

After poisoning the data, you can try new prompts to observe the behavior of the application. For example:
```text
Get list of usernames
```
